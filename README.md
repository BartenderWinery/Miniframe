# Information
Miniframe is an HTML Javascript tool designed for chromium browsers. It is a window iframe that you can drag, close, and resize. By default, it is routed to my website; aeroweb.netlify.com. You can either change the default value by just simply looking for that URL in the code and changing it, or you can type engine.exec("iframe",["any website here"]) into my website.

# Setting up
To set up the browser, first, create a bookmark. Secondly, right-click that bookmark and press edit. Lastly, you can put the compiled JS code into the URL input box. Now simply pressing the bookmark will execute the code and inject a window into your current website.
